Overlord: The once customizable close combat monstrosity can now only replace his Staff of Light (the shooty option) with a Hyperphase Sword (the cheap option), a Voidblade (the anti-horde option), a Voidscythe (the anti-Vehicle option) or a Warscythe (the anti-Primaris option), all more or less equally good depending your list and matchups. They come with a 4+ invulnerable save thanks to the Phase Shifter included in the kit. Their only non-weapon upgrade (aside from relics) is the Resurrection Orb, which is pretty good for our Troops but is more or less a must-have if you have Lychguard or Destroyers close to your Overlord. The main reason (and it's a good one) to buy an Overlord instead of a Lord is his buff My Will Be Done. Note that the Overlord comes stock with a flat 3 attacks which makes him fairly weak at duelling compared to almost every other HQ. Do not let the 5 wounds fool you, he will go down fast to any decent beatstick character. Think instead of your Overlord as a charge deterrent, buffing a blob of immortals and discouraging harassment units like reivers. The only time your overlord should be duelling characters is with supporting Lychguard to tank wounds, otherwise, you'll watch him die in one round of combat. Also, do not forget the stratagem that allows the first attack made by a character to ignore invulnerable saves. While it won't secure the punch up, it will allow your overlord to take a chunk out of whatever special snowflake manages to kill him next turn.

Lord: Comes with The Lord's Will ability which lets you reroll failed wound rolls of 1, which arguably makes him better at babysitting 20 man warrior blobs than a Cryptek (The Lord is the stern father compared to the protective mother of the Cryptek). He cannot get a Voidscythe and he does not have an invulnerable save, he can have a Staff of Light (the staying safe option), Hyperphase Sword (the cheap option), a Voidblade (the down and dirty option) or a Warscythe (the killy option). The Warscythe is a little overkill for this guy because he will die so quickly when he gets into combat, but the other options are solid. The Resurrection Orb can be a trap against armies with lots of snipers because it makes the Lord much more expensive and he is relatively easy to kill.

Cryptek: Your defensive buff-bot. Every <DYNASTY> unit within 3" gets +1 to RP rolls. Still no fun Harbinger options, but for that, you can take Szeras or Orikan and pretend you are playing 6th edition. When taking a Cryptek you always want to either give him a Canoptek Cloak or a Chronometron, the Canoptek Cloak allows Crypteks to keep up with speedier units and provide extra healing for anything with Living Metal for only a marginal points increase, if your tables include little terrain or if you are bringing Lychguard with Warscythes or Necron Warriors you will instead want the Chronometron, which gives your INFANTRY units within 3" a 5++ against shooting, it is a little more expensive though and offers less mobility making it more of a niche choice. 

Destroyer Lord: Lost some versatility from the previous edition in that he only buffs Destroyers and Heavy Destroyers. Yet, comes with Phase Shifter standard and 1 more Attack and Toughness than a Lord or Overlord and 1 more wound than the Overlord. His high movement does allow him to keep up with Destroyers which is harder for a normal Lord. The only HQ that can take a phylactery, which is generally an auto-include to make him heal D3 at the start of your turn instead of the standard 1. His buff is not as good as that of a Lord's but he is much tougher and mobile, he is a good choice if you are spamming Destroyers or you don't have any Infantry to benefit from Overlord and Lord. If you take a Destroyer Lord you should definitely give him a warscythe and get him stuck in melee, the cheaper and shootier weapon options are basically wasting the Destroyer Lord body. Destroyer Lords should probably also take a relic to maximize their effectiveness.

Catacomb Command Barge: Has Quantum Shielding and a Gauss or Tesla cannon like a vehicle, but doesn't get worse as it takes damage (just like the Annihilation barge). It also includes a 12" version of My Will Be Done, the ability to charge flyers with a Warscythe, and the privilege to laugh in the face of Dark Eldar carrying poison weaponry (because it's a VEHICLE). It is a nice upgrade for a vanilla Overlord between the durability and range buffs. You want to take a Warscythe or a Staff of Light on this guy, you are already paying quite a lot, the cheaper weapons just are not worth it in this case. The Staff of Light finds its best character in this guy since he can fall back and shoot since he can FLY. 
Anrakyr the Traveller: Overlord with S6 and an extra wound and a single shot with his Tachyon Arrow at range 120" S10 AP -5 and D D6. He can boss around models from any Dynasty and even Triarch Praetorians with his MWBD ability and he can copy one of the weapons of an enemy vehicle within 12" on a 4+. When he does he fires it using the vehicle's BS but due to poor wording, the shot counts as originating from Anrakyr's model. Recommended in all Apocalypse styled battles if you aren't afraid of being That guy. Lastly, Anrakyr gives all nearby NECRON INFANTRY units an additional attack which makes our regular infantry a lot scarier. He's basically a must-have in lists that feature multiple Lychguard and/or Triarch Praetorian units, but even if you're just buffing Warriors and Immortals he's worth it if he can buff 30+ models and a couple of other characters. If he's your Warlord he has the Implacable Conquerer trait, which is great if he's buffing a bunch of melee units, but not the best option if you're just using him to make your Troops a tiny bit scarier in melee.

Illuminor Szeras: An odd duck of a character, he has 4 Attacks with AP -2 in melee and a range 36" S 8 AP -4 D D6 Heavy 1 weapon, he's slightly more durable than a Cryptek with 5 W and 3+ Sv. He has M 6 instead of 5 because of his spider legs but doesn't get a Cryptek Cloak or a Chronometron. He can give a random buff to a Warrior or Immortal unit (+1 BS, +1 S or +1 T) but each unit can only be upgraded once. His Technomancer ability buffs all NECRON units instead of just INFANTRY from a single Dynasty. He's the only one that can heal Triarch Praetorians, but he can only improve Immortals and Warriors. If he's your Warlord he gets Immortal Pride, which is nice in a Warrior or Immortal character bubble army. He is a bit pricy but he fits in some niche armies like ones that include Triarch Praetorians or multiple dynasties, he's very nice if all you need is a character to fill a spot in your Nephrekh Outrider Detachment when all your Infantry is Mephrit or Sautekh.
Necron Warriors: Our basic Infantry model. If you're using them you're better off taking them as 20 man blobs since Reanimation Protocols are more effective the more models there are in the unit, but this leaves you open to taking Morale tests with as much as -19, having enough CP to automatically pass these tests at key moments or picking the Warlord Trait that allows you to automatically pass is essential to making these big Warrior blobs work, otherwise you are better off with Immortals. AP could have its own article, but the TL;DR is that AP-1 makes Flayers 100% more effective against TEQs as Bolters, and a 50% more effective against MEQs than a bolter. Warriors take 50% more wounds compared to Immortals against things like Bolters and Lasguns, but their worse armour isn't such a big deal against things like plasma or earthshaker cannons, the armour difference actually makes no difference against things with an AP of -2 or better when accompanied by a Cryptek with a Chronometron since they will both have a 5+ Sv. Warriors are the best troops choice against high-AP low armour units like Bloodletters, Genestealers and Harlequins, Gauss Immortals are the best troops choice against low-AP high armour units like Space Marines or Immortals, Tesla Immortals are good against low-AP low armour units like Orks or Guardsmen. 

Immortals: 36% more points than a Warrior for a +1 to their save and access to either a Gauss Blaster, which is S5 AP-2 Rapid Fire, or the Tesla Carbine which is Assault 2 S5 Tesla. My Will Be Done boosts Tesla Carbine effectiveness significantly, causing triple hits on 5s and 6s - Advancing and Shooting with Tesla stops you from getting a triple hits on 6s because of the -1 to hit (MWBD can counteract any penalties to your Hit rolls your opponent may inflict on your Tesla Immortals). For Immortals cover is far more important because a 2+ Sv is twice as effective as a 3+ while a 3+ is only 50% more effective compared to a 4+, if you want a unit you can march into the thick of it without care for the casualties they take, the Immortals are too expensive to be that choice. Squads of 5 Immortals are our least costly Troops choice, like Warriors the bigger your unit of Immortals the more likely they are to benefit from Reanimation Protocols and the more likely they are to suffer from Morale issues. See the Tesla vs Gauss section in the Talk page for the mathhammer on which weapon option is best, but here's the TL;DR: Ask yourself these three questions: Can I make sure my Immortals will stay inside 12"; Does my enemy have lots of 3+ or better saves; Does my enemy have no horde units. If you answer "No" to any of those, Tesla is better (you can put out an average of 13 wounds per turn at 24" against any unit with less than 5T, and it only starts losing out to Gauss against 4+ and better saves). Otherwise, stick with Gauss.
Lychguard: S and T 5 and 2 Attacks compared to Immortals S and T 4 and 1 Attack, Lychguard are our pseudo-Terminators. An expensive melee unit, but Lychguard are only M5 and have no mobility abilities making them sitting ducks against Shooting armies. They come in two varieties: the sword and board, which makes the unit far less of a sitting duck, or the Warscythe variety which makes them an actual threat with S7 AP-4 and D2. You will want a Cryptek with a Chronometron if you are taking the Warscythe variety. Lychguard are now a real honour guard with the ability to take a mortal wound to negate a wound suffered by a <DYNASTY> CHARACTER within 3" on a roll of 2+. Do note that this means they cannot take a wound for either Anrakyr the Traveller or Illuminor Szeras, suppose they cut their paycheck or something. Remember that most of your CHARACTERS have Living Metal before you go diving in to block every last wound with these guys - your lords will regenerate 1 point of damage by themselves each turn. Even though Anrakyr the Traveller doesn't benefit from the body guard special rule the extra attack from Anrakyr's Lord of the Pyrrhian Legions special rule increases their offensive ability by 50%, Ouch! On paper they look like mini combat monsters, however each Lychguard costs 2.5 Warriors, they provide no Shooting and 5" move leaves something to be desired. Dropping them in with a Monolith, Night Scythe, Zhandrek + Obyron, The Deceiver, or the Veil of Darkness relic is practically mandatory.

Deathmarks: Deep Striking Immortals with Rapid Fire sniper rifles. As the faction's snipers, they inflict an extra mortal wound on a wound roll of 6+ and can target CHARACTERS, great against heavily armoured units, decent against vehicles and characters, their main strength is their ability to Deep Strike, spending the pts on a single unit of 5 just to be able to take a stray objective turn 2 can sometimes be worth it if you're running an otherwise slow army. When an enemy unit arrives from reserves you can bring one of your Deathmark units out from Reserves and immediately shoot at that unit, this is great if your opponent has multiple units in reserve as you can block the room where your opponent might want to place their other reinforcing units, although this rule is less great against things like Drop Pods since you will be forced to shoot at the empty Drop Pod after the unit inside disembarks. Not really worth spamming, if you want to assasinate characters you're better off relying on C'tan with Cosmic Fire, although Deathmarks could be part of a tactic to finish off any survivors.

Flayed Ones: Warriors with 3 attacks each, the ability to deep strike and the ability to re-roll failed wounds instead of a shooting weapon. In addition, they also add +1 to morale tests on the units they cut them. They got a price drop in the Codex at the price of one attack, making them much less of a glass... knife? A unit of 20 can still put out 60 attacks hitting on 3+ and re-rolling failed wounds, this makes them Rape pretty much anything from Guardsmen to Baneblades. You don't need to take the nuclear option of 20 Flayed Ones, a unit of 5 can grab objectives and won't leave several hundred points to be rapid fired to death should you fail the 10" charge.

Triarch Praetorians: Praetorians are like Lychguard, except they have Movement 10 FLY and can either have a Rod of Covenant or a Voidblade and a Particle Caster. If you get within 12" of an enemy unit one of two things are going to happen, either you fire a Particle Caster or a Rod of Covenant. The Rod of Covenant will deal more damage and then you will either make the charge and the extra attack you get from the Voidblade will make the total damage output of Voidblade/Particle Caster better or you will fail and the Rod of Covenant will have dealt the most damage. No <DYNASTY> on these guys, so you'll need Anrakyr or Imotekh to use My Will Be Done on them and they'll miss out on other Dynasty-linked abilities but they do automatically pass morale tests.

Triarch Stalker: Spiderbot with a spider rider, a tough support unit usually well worth its points, but a bit less potent in the codex in comparison to the buffed DDAs and Heavy Destroyers. All Necron units reroll 1s while shooting at something that has been attacked by a Stalker's in the same turn. Note that you don't actually need to hit or even wound the target, you only need to declare an attack against it for army-wide rerolls against the target. Can have a Heat Ray which is underwhelming most of the time except if you can get within 12", Particle Shredder which is better against hordes or Twin Heavy Gauss Cannon so you have more range, range is pretty important since you want to keep this thing behind your lines since it can't fall back and shoot like your other vehicles. Durable with Quantum Shielding, isn't helpless in close combat either. Same "no <DYNASTY>" issue as the Praetorians though, it can support units from several different dynasties at once, although it is useless for Nihilakh units if they do not move.

C'tan Shard of the Nightbringer: Hello Darkness Death, my old friend. Seems GW changed you up again. Still with your deadly gaze softly creeping, and your fleshbane scythe to reap the weeping. The S and T 7, along with lacklustre 4++ save, still remain. Within the sound of silence At least you have 8 wounds now. But more importantly, the CHARACTER rules remove the C'tan shards' greatest weakness - being gunned down before reaching their target. Now your opponent can only target them with snipers as long as you bubble wrap them. Welcome back Darkness Nightbringer, may you reap the battlefield once more. He knows two Powers of the C'tan and can use one of them at the end of the movement phase. Really cheap for what he does, a great addition to a list with a melee bent. C'tan Shards can be useful even in death thanks to Reality Unravels - a re-fluffed Explodes that deals D3 mortal wounds on a 4+ to every unit within 3". Just don't stand too close yourself. Also, The Nightbringer doesn't like vehicles, the machine spirit isn't enough of a soul for him to reap, so his Scythe hits with S7 and his Gaze wounds on 6+ against metal boxes instead of wounding on 2+. Yet, even if it is rare, it is a great moment when The Nightbringer blows up a tank by staring at it. Half of the C'tan powers are effective against vehicles, however, so he is far from helpless.
Take Cosmic Fire and either Anti-matter Meteor or Transdimensional Thunderbolt if possible.

C'tan Shard of the Deceiver: Same C'tan body as the Nightbringer and same access to Powers of the C'tan, but trades the ranged weapon and Fleshbane in melee for Grand Illusion  and a 12" -1 Ld aura. After deployment, but before the first turn begins, you can redeploy the Deceiver and/or up to D3 other friendly NECRON units at least 12" from any enemy model, but they can't charge on the first turn. See Tactics sections for the cheese. Like the Nightbringer shard, Reality Unravels when he dies. Don't stand too close, and preferably try to make sure he's near the enemy if it happens. Also like the Nightbringer, he's a sub-10 Wound CHARACTER and as such can't be targeted by shooting if you hide him behind your other units.
Cosmic Fire is amazing because you can redeploy the Deceiver 12" away and then Advance in and blast the entire enemy army turn 1. Anti-matter Meteor or Transdimensional Thunderbolt are great back-up powers, but the Deceiver will usually rely on Cosmic Fire.

Canoptek Tomb Stalker (Forge World): Your regular monstrous creature. 6 attacks at S6 AP-2 D D3, which is ok, but it cannot chew through vehicles like it could in previous editions. Carries a Rapid Fire D3 gun which is nothing special. It can take a Gloom Prism, and also deep strikes so it can mess with psykers. The Spyder is your defensive support but the Stalker is a full-on aggressive support. And fine, with T7, 9 wounds and a decent save, deep striking this does make for a nice... distraction.
Canoptek Wraiths: Canoptek Wraiths are pretty tough with their incredible 3+ invulnerable save 3 Wounds Toughness 5 and with the new codex they also hit pretty hard with 3 Attacks WS 3+ AP2 and D2, but their price took a big hike so they are no longer worth just throwing at anything, ideally you want to throw them at enemy melee units that don't deal multiple damage and that have high AP values, if you're fighting hordes you are better off just swarming them with Scarabs, perhaps you're just better off swarming anything that moves with Scarabs. The ability to retreat and assault is interesting since it means you cannot be tarpitted, the ability to move through walls and units can also come in handy in all kinds of circumstances. Whipcoils no longer guarantee that they attack first, but instead allow them to attack during the Fight phase that it dies if has not already fought, this option is far too expensive to be worth it though. The Transdimensional Beamer increases your damage output against elite units and the Particle Caster increases your damage output against hordes. With the increased cost and damage output Wraiths are becoming quite the target and are likely to be the focus of all your opponent's anti-infantry weaponry, so keeping them cheap is probably the best way to go, unless you know you have other more juicy targets like Flayed Ones and Heavy Destroyers.

Canoptek Scarabs: Scarabs aren't really meant to kill things like they were in previous editions, although they can wound anything on a 5+, The Self-Destruction Stratagem does allow them to cause a few mortal wounds at the cost of a single base worth of Scarabs and if you scrape enough of them together you might be able to challenge enemy melee units. Their main strengths are their high Movement of 10 coupled with FLY which makes them quite mobile, allowing them to zone parts of the board to prevent Deep Striking and allowing you to take objectives without having to move your expensive fighting units out of the way. Their low cost per wound also makes them pretty good at tarpitting enemy elite Melee and all kinds of Shooting units, this is especially useful when they are coupled with characters and C'tan, let the characters deal the damage, while the Scarabs soak up enemy attacks. They are still quite squishy though, so ideally you want to hide them behind a hill or a building before charging in. They can be replenished by Spyders, but their units can no longer exceed their starting strength, the rule is pretty lackluster and Scarabs generally work fine on their own. Smaller units are often discouraged because of first blood, on the other hand smaller units do allow you more freedom to split up and take different objectives or assault several smaller squads. Squads bigger than 5 start having issues with Morale, take 7 to maximize the number of Scarabs in your list and avoid almost all the dangers of Morale.

Tomb Blades: Tomb Blades are like two Immortals in that they have two wounds and can either have two Tesla Carbines, two Gauss Blasters or if you're feeling cheap they can have a single Particle Beamer, well except that they have +1 Toughness and a -1 To Hit modifier in the enemy Shooting phase, and that they unfortunately only have a 4+ Sv, but a massive Movement 14 in place of the Immortal's 5. So not really like Immortals. They can pay a few more points to improve their save with the shield vanes upgrade, which is nice if you are expecting to be shot by Boltguns and Flashlights, but not worth it if you are expecting lots of high-ap weaponry, going from a 7+ to a 6+ only improves your durability by 16%, which could be better used to buy more models, but against low AP weapons, it's a 33% increase in durability which is more worth it. Another difference between Immortals and Tomb Blades is that they are Bikes, which is cool, but comes with some downsides, it means they don't benefit from MWBD or most of our aura abilities it also means they don't benefit from being in cover, meaning they have a hard time fighting enemies in cover since they cannot themselves take cover, the Nebuloscopes however allows you to ignore enemy cover if that's a big concern, this isn't really worth it if you're going for the Gauss Blasters, but is definitely worth it against MEQ units that take cover if you are using one of the other weapon options. Shadowlooms are their last upgrade, which they cannot take along with Nebuloscopes, it gives them a 5+ invulnerable save, which would be good against stuff like plasma, you could play it safe by taking both Nebuloscopes and Shield Vanes, but then you're losing out on firepower relative to your cost and you might as well just take extra models. Due to them not benefitting from MWBD they cannot abuse the Tesla rule like Immortals can unless you use the Sautekh Stratagem Methodical Destruction to add +1 to their Hit rolls. Their mobility makes the Gauss Blaster an ideal weapon for them since they can quickly get into Rapid Fire range. Overall a comfortably priced unit that behaves like other bikes of other races, though it trades melee ability for increased dakka.

Destroyers: 3 Strength 6 shots at AP-3 re-rolling 1s to Hit make these guys excellent MEQ killers, their ability to FLY away and shoot makes them an ideal choice against elite melee armies, especially after the buffs they got in the codex. S 6 isn't quite enough to take out heavy vehicles, but with the Extermination Protocols Stratagem they are more than capable of hunting vehicles, otherwise you are wasting your firepower. Light vehicles (<T7) have all right to fear Destroyer's Gauss Cannons. If you have 12 or more Destroyers you should definitely get a Destroyer Lord (Or a regular Lord, if you wanna buff more than just Destroyers) so they can reroll 1s when wounding, if you only have one unit or several smaller ones you're probably better off investing in other HQs. Their respectable offense is complemented with movement and defense, being the only 3 Wound unit with Reanimation Protocols (remember that models do raise with full wounds now, making a unit of 6 Destroyers one of the best targets for a Resurrection Orb, averaging 60 pts if you had lost 5 in the previous turn). There is a max of 1 Heavy Destroyer per Destroyer unit, taking one is definitely a good idea with the new rules allowing the Heavy Destroyer to target vehicles while your regular Destroyers target MEQs or TEQs. As with most units with Reanimation Protocols, you want a big unit of them. Because if you have 4, and you opponents shoots down 4, they are gone. But, if you had 5, that is over 200 points potentially all saved. A full squad does cost a lot (300 with 6 destroyers), but it is the safer bet compared to bringing two squads of 3. With Destroyers, go big. And bring a Cryptek. And an Overlord. And a Lord or a Destroyer Lord.

Canoptek Acanthrites (Forge World): 6 more points than a Wraith with 4 attacks at S5 AP-3 D1 instead of 3 attacks S6 AP-2 D2 from the Wraiths, the Acanthrites are the clear winners against most infantry, but against multi-wound models they just can't keep up in melee. However, they do have S7 AP-4 Dd6 Assault 1 weapons for just that, making the Canoptek Acanthrites better at killing pretty much anything the Wraiths can kill assuming you don't get caught up in a prolonged fight. Wraiths do have better defenses with a 3++ (vs the Acanthrites' 3+ Sv, no invul and -1 to shoot them), Acanthrites also cannot claim a cover save due to them being beasts, making them very susceptible to any elite melee unit and they are going to get pulverised by shooting attacks with any kind of AP even with a -1 to hit. Perhaps best slotted into an army with other armoured targets so they do not get targeted by lascannons.

Canoptek Tomb Sentinel (Forge World): A shootier version of the Tomb Stalker, 2 attacks less than the Canoptek Tomb Stalker but with what is basically the Doom Scythe gun. A heavy gun on a mostly melee unit, following the style of Wraiths, meaning you're almost always going to be hitting on 4+ like the Doom Scythe. It can take a Gloom Prism, and has little reason not to. The gun is well worth the 15 points it costs more than the Canoptek Tomb Stalker, but it can get bogged down a lot easier since it only has 4 attacks. It's less reliant on making that charge when it deep strikes since it at least gets to shoot something worthwhile even if it fails its charge. It's expensive and it makes a big [[1]] out of itself, if you want to take some heat off some other units and you need the anti-tank more than you need the anti-infantry then you should consider this one.
Heavy Destroyers: Scary guns mounted on spooky hover skeletons that hit on 3+ rerolling ones. Combo with My Will Be Done to hit on 2+ rerolling ones. They also reach 36" and suffer no penalty for moving and shooting. This is our best anti-vehicle unit if that's all you're looking for, but you're still paying for their mobility even if that cost was reduced with the codex and Chapter Approved. They are pretty squishy compared to Doomsday Arks and are good at shooting a much smaller number of things compared to Destroyers, making them not the greatest. Finding cover for these guys is usually easy since they are Infantry, getting that 2+ Sv is important if you want these guys to survive. Take them in squads of 3 so you get to try to revive them if any survive the enemy's shooting or in units of 1 if you're bad at rolling Reanimation Protocols and you're hoping your enemy will use excessive firepower to remove the last wound from that single Heavy Destroyer. A regular Lord is a better support character for these guys than a Destroyer Lord and is pretty much mandatory.

Canoptek Spyders: Canoptek Spyders are big squishy support gripplies with a little bit of a kick in close combat. You only want to take these guys for the Fabricator Claw Array upgrade allowing you to heal D3 Vehicle wounds per turn, they can also spawn more scarabs on a 2+ if they happen to be nearby, it's nice but not really worth investing in a Spyder unless you'll be using it to heal vehicles. Gloom Prisms are mandatory if you are not planning on staying back and healing your DDAs all game. They're squishy as hell so you don't want to buy a gun for them, just hope your opponent lets you keep healing your vehicles. Hide them behind a Monolith or behind a building if possible.

Monolith: It is a Deep Striking Leman Russ with 8 more wounds and Living Metal and it is Titanic, it's firepower doesn't really add up to its points so you'll have to find value in other aspects of the Monolith. The Monolith is huge you can use it to block line of sight, it has FLY so it can fall back and shoot if it doesn't get surrounded, can Deep Strike at 12", it can do mortal wounds to any non-Vehicle/Monster units that end their Charge within 1" of the Monolith, it has BS 3+ and can move and fire without penalty. Lastly it has the Eternity Gate ability allowing you to put units in Reinforcements and Deep Strike up to one unit within 3" before the Monolith moves, the unit then acts as if it had disembarked from a Transport. In matched play games any units that are put into Reinforcements via this ability and have not been brought out by a Monolith or Night Scythe before turn 4 are destroyed and any units inside cannot come out before turn 2, this makes using this ability extremely risky at the best of times and downright suicidal against Shooting armies. You want to prevent this thing from being surrounded as best you can, because once it is surrounded it is useless. The Monolith is near useless, it does have a couple of handy Stratagems, but the amount of firepower it takes away from you is not worth the versatility it brings. 

Annihilation Barge: Fast shooty little vehicle with 8 W T 6 4+ Sv and Quantum Shielding. Don't mistake the relatively high S of 7 on its main weapon to mean it's meant to shoot at anything other than infantry, use it in the same way you would Tesla Tomb Blades, against horde infantry and the like. Its Overwatch is nasty because of tesla and it can retreat and then fire because of fly, making it an ideal stop-gap against horde melee units. Both Gauss Cannon and Tesla Cannon are worth their points, the Tesla does fit better with its overall role of being annoying against enemy infantry, the -1 to hit for moving with the Gauss Cannon is also kind of annoying. Charging it into enemy ranged infantry units is a good idea. With Tomb Blades you get signifigantly more firepower, less so against high-Toughness targets such as Grotesques, but you also get one more Toughness instead of -1 to Hit, making the Annihilation Barge ideal against armies with a lot of S 3 or Poisoned shooting, that is if you are looking for a Fast Shooty unit, with Tesla Immortals it is signifigantly easier to abuse Tesla and get it down to 5s and 6s with My Will Be Done from an Overlord, the Annihilation Barge is still pretty squishy but at least it doesn't care about the Morale phase.  

Doomsday Ark: It's a Ghost Ark with a our only Codex long-ranged weapon instead of healing and transporting abilities and it's good if you're planning on playing defensively and making your opponent come to you, otherwise you won't get to use the Flayer Arrays which makes it inferior to Heavy Destroyers or Doom Scythes. Its Doomsday Cannon still works better if you don't move, increasing its Strength, AP, Damage, and range. Quantum Shielding is really nice since most long-ranged weapons that can reach it in your back line will usually deal D6 damage, in these cases the Doomsday Ark is awesome, but if your opponent brings anything with D2 then it quickly becomes scrap metal.

Transcendent C'tan: Like the Deceiver and Nightbringer, Transcendent C'tan now know 2 powers of the C'tan and can cast one per turn and cannot get Warlord Traits. Barring a good roll on the random personality trait chart they got with the codex the Transcendent C'tan is still the worst of the three C'tan, but it is almost on par with it's named brethren now which isn't too shabby at all, if not something you're going to be winning any GTs with. Roll these up the board with Wraiths or Scarabs or redeploy them with the Deceiver for a massive mortal wound bomb T1. Transcendent C'tan have the same stats as the Deceiver, except they get D6 damage on their melee weapon compared to the Deceiver's flat 3 (which is a downgrade against 2 and 3 wound models but generally a slight upgrade against vehicles). Instead of the Gaze of Death and Scythe of the Nightbringer weapons that the Shard of the Nightbringer gets or the Dread and Grand Illusion abilities that the Shard of the Deceiver get they got a new ability called Fractured Personality which lets you roll two traits on a list of 6 traits, if you roll a double then you only get that one trait, instead of rolling you can select a single power. Pick Cosmic Tyrant or Immune to Natural Law if you don't want to roll, three Transcendent C'tan all using two powers each turn output a lot of MWs if that's something you're into. Note that since rolling for these powers happens before the game starts you cannot re-roll them. 
Cosmic Tyrant: The C'tan can cast two Powers of the C'tan instead of one.
Immune to Natural Law: Gain +1 to saving throws (3+/3++). 
Sentient Necrodermis: Heal D3 wounds at the start of each of your turns.
Transdimensional Displacement: When Advancing, add 12" to this model's movement instead of rolling.
Entropic Touch: Re-roll all failed wound rolls in the Fight phase.
Writhing Worldscape: Enemy units within 12" do not receive bonuses to their saving throws from cover.

Tesseract Ark (Forge World): Tougher, more expensive and more versatile version of the Doomsday Ark. It has an anti-vehicle profile which is weaker than the Doomsday Cannon, but it has two other profiles one for taking out TEQs at range 24" and one a flamer for taking out MEQ at 8". Comes with 2 Tesla Cannons, which can be replaced with 2 Particle Beamers (if you are an idiot) or 2 Gauss Cannons which have become a nice option with the buff in the codex. It also has a special rule that subtracts from the charge distance of enemies trying to charge it, at worst this means your opponent can't charge from 9" away to avoid your flamer, at best it means your opponent will fail their charge and you get to inflict D6 auto-hits wounding on 2+. The explosion rule for the Tesseract Ark also triggers on a 4+ so make sure your near a lot of enemy units when it dies and then use a re-roll if necessary to inflict lots of mortal wounds.

Sentry Pylon (Forge World): Gun platforms that can scuttle along the battlefield 3" a turn with the option to buy Deep Strike. Gauss exterminators are good for flyers and ground support with two S12 shots. Focussed Death Ray is 15 points cheaper, but it's also terrible; half range and shots compared to the Gauss Exterminator with same profile. It lacks the +1 to-hit against non-FLY units, but the Gauss Exterminator shoots twice - so it has a better chance of landing at least one shot, and can also land two (and has +1 to hit vs FLY). The Heat Cannon will generally work out better than the Exterminator (at 1.75x the rate of fire for 1.5x the points before you pay for the wielder, and with melta damage at 18"), but it's also 25 extra points, if you take the latter you want to take the option that allows Sentry Pylons to deepstrike, if you go with the Gauss Exterminator then just plunk it down during Deployment instead of waiting until turn 2.
Ghost Ark: Ghost Arks are primarily a support unit for Warriors, but also carry the equivalent firepower of 10 Warriors and the ability to provide protection for your Warriors or characters at the cost of units inside being unable to use their abilities or fire their weapons. This ability is useful only when your Warriors Fall Back from melee (as then they can't do anything else anyway), or when the squad or character is down to only a couple of models or wounds and you want to try and avoid having them wiped out. Repair Barge allows all <DYNASTY> Warrior units within 3" or embarked on one or more Ghost Arks to make a second Reanimation Protocols roll at the end of the Movement phase (note that you cannot combine Ghost Arks and Resurrection Orbs). Even if you did not have a Cryptek within 3" of your Warriors at the beginning of your turn, if you can manage to get one within 3" at the end of your Movement phase a squad of Warriors will regenerate 67% of its lost models between its initial RP roll and the Cryptek-boosted Ghost Ark RP roll. Toughness 6 makes it tough against lasguns, Quantum Shielding makes it tough against lascannons, but it's weak to D2 weapons, especially if they are S6-7. 
The Ghost Ark can also double as an effective speed bump against weaker Melee units, using it as a battering ram against enemy ranged units, preventing them from Shooting and firing Overwatch is also an effective tactic. Because it has FLY keyword it can fall back a few inches after being charged while still Shooting.
Mephrit Ghost Arks are the best ones to bring for battering ram. Especially if you use the Deceiver to Grand Illusion them into the Opponents face for 20-40 S4 AP-2 D1 shots with both units being able to charge Turn 2 onwards. Most opponents don't see these as threats so you will more then likely have both by turn 2 as well.
Night Scythe: Basically the same transport portal as the Monolith, but on a flyer with Tesla Destructors. Has suffered a fair bit from the previous edition; lacking Quantum Shielding makes for one of the frailest vehicles in the codex. Still has 12 Wounds, though that will only get you so far. With the general nerf to S7 weapons, its Tesla Destructors aren't very scary either. Necrons may just be packing up their flying circus. The new Stratagems as well as a price drop helps, still too pricey for what it does. They are decent against melee armies because units without Fly cannot charge them. 

Doom Scythe: Night Scythe but with a Heavy D3 S10 AP-5 gun instead of the portal at a slightly higher price, definitely better than the Night Scythe, but the between the fewer shots and hitting on 4s it doesn't compare too well to Doomsday Arks. Heavy Destroyers are better at hurting stuff and are also pretty mobile, but are a little more vulnerable, the inability to grab objectives and take cover also hurts. Doomsday Arks have more firepower and durability but lack any sort of mobility. Even with their lackluster performance they're still a mainstay in competitive necron lists for their Stratagem: Amalgamated Targetting Data. Which can throw a lot of MW into someone's castle if you run 3 Doom Scythes. It's kind of a gimmick but if it works it works great. Take Sautekh as your dynasty with these.

Night Shroud (Forge World): Doom scythe with +1 T and +2 wounds while replacing the Death Ray with a once per game Death Sphere strafing run. Death Spheres are the most powerful aircraft bomb in the game, inflicting a mortal wound on a 3+ and rolling 1d6 per model/3d6 per VEHICLE/MONSTER (capped at 12 dice). Averages a little less than 7 mortal wounds on a 10 model unit, or 2 mortal wounds on a VEHICLE or MONSTER. Average of 8 mortal wounds against the rare few units of light vehicles that still exist, such as Killa Kans and Grot Tanks. It does let you pick out CHARACTERS (as the attack doesn't occur in the shooting phase and so isn't bound by that targeting restriction), Hive Tyrants, C'tan and Daemon Princes come to mind.
Seraptek Heavy Construct (Forge World): It’s about time the Necrons got themselves a knight analogue (and a Knight Dominus at that). The Seraptek is a monster of a war machine, with 28W T8 3+/5++ like the Imperial Dominus Class and some pretty nasty weaponry. More over, it's fucking FAST, scuttling across the board at 16", compared to the 12" of the Imperial Knights. Thankfully it gets to use that Movement because it doesn't suffer To Hit penalties for firing Heavy weapons on the move, it can also always walk over  Infantry and Swarms at any time, not just in combat, where normal Knights can be locked in the Movement Phase by being surrounded but outside combat. It also gets to fall back, Shoot and then Charge in the same turn like other Knight equivalents. For all your Primarch evaporating needs, it starts with two massive Singularity Generator cannons - each a 36" Heavy 3D3 S8 AP-3 D6 damage gun, that also does 1 mortal wound in addition to the normal damage on a wound roll of 6. Alternatively, you can drop them for the more versatile four weapon loadout with a pair of Transdimensional Projectors (24" Heavy D6 S6 AP-3 D3 damage with the same 1 MW on 6+ as the stock weapons) and 2 Synaptic Obliterators (72" Heavy D3 S16 AP-4 6 damage flat!) It also brings its Titanic Forelimbs to melee, making 6 attacks with 2 profiles that pretty much copy the stat lines of a Knight's Titanic Feet and Reaper Chainsword respectively, it's attack characteristic is 50% better than that of regular Imperial Knights and its weapon skill is better than that of Dominus Class Knights. It's cost and statline makes it immediately comparable to a Knight Valiant, they have about equivalent amounts of firepower, but the lack of access to durability improving Stratagems, Relics and Warlord traits makes it a firemagnet with no way to turn itself off, run it with other glass-cannon units for maximum efficiency. Take it in a Supreme Command Detachment or with a couple of Tesseract Vaults to unlock your Dynasty bonus, you really don't want to invest 600 pts and then not even have a Dynasty bonus. As far as competitive goes it's probably a little early to say, but many gunlines will be able to put it down T1 relatively easily, it is a pretty potent counter to melee Knights, but a Castellan can put it down without too much fuss. Less potent than a Vault against Hordes, more potent against Knights, potentially one of the more viable Necron units in competitive contexts. 

Obelisk: 24 Wounds 3+ Sv and an average of 20 S7 AP- hits (yes hits, not shots - the triple shots compensate for your misses on average). It has a Movement of 8, but it can Deep Strike (albeit at more than 12" instead of 9") so it's guaranteed to at least shoot once even if it's durability is atrocious for its cost, even more so when considering it's TITANIC and therefore falls to a single round of shooting from a Gauss Pylon or Shadowsword. Once per turn you can roll a D6 for each enemy unit with FLY within 24", dealing D3 mortal wounds on a roll of 6+ (4+ if you spend 1 CP), this ability will do very little against a lot of armies and will be amazing against a few armies. The Obelisk overall is horrible, but it will make some opponents cry.

Tesseract Vault: A Transcendent C'tan suspended within a huge living metal cage, it spews out copious amounts of AP- and mortal wounds but it's spicy pricy and will attract ALL the attention of your opponent. Knows four, and can use 1-3, Powers of the C'tan each turn depending on how many wounds it has left. It doesn't get to keep the C'tan's close combat prowess or their ability to hide in infantry units (as it has 28 Wounds), has a low (for a Lord of War) Toughness of 7, but with the codex it now has a 4+ invulnerable which is all kinds of nice. Still, concentrated fire (or a Macro weapon, as it's TITANIC) will bring this thing down quite quickly, so you want to get it in range quickly and try to keep it alive as long as you can. A good way to get it up quickly is to use the Deceiver to get it into your opponent's face turn 1. If you're taking this thing you better make the rest of your army a glass cannon so you at least get to inflict some major damage with the rest of your army while this thing gets taken down. Makes a massive explosion of rape when it dies, ideally this happens away from your models and close to several enemy units. 
Even though this unit has the dynasty keyword this unit cannot benefit from the codes due to also having the C'TAN SHARD key word. This however still means a cryptek with a cloak can still heal this unit for D3 wounds over the 1 from living metal and you can still use dynasty-specific Stratagems.

Gauss Pylon (Forge World): 30 T8 Wounds and countless sheckles worth of Deep Striking anti-tank gun with a protective field granting a 5+ invulnerable save for models (including vehicles) within 6", it can't move after deep striking but all your units can target units in combat with the Pylon. The Gauss Annihilator's Focused Beam mode is S16, so you're wounding pretty much everything in the game on 2s (and even wounding Warlord Titans on a 4+). Only AP-4 but that makes little difference since many enemies will have invulnerable saves anyway. It is so strong against TITANIC that you should always ask your opponent before friendly games if they're bringing one, if it's not a friendly game... Well enjoy 2x(6+D3) damage. It's other weapon profiles aren't even worth mentioning, but I will, it has a 3" anti-infantry gun and a Heavy 2D6 anti-MEQ gun, but firing either prevents firing the main gun. It's good even against moderately heavy vehicles like Predators and great against Land Raiders and daemon primarchs. It's terrible against units with Quantum Shielding since it can't less than 6 damage, it's also a very expensive paperweight against horde armies.
Tomb Citadel (Forge World): Contains an Eternity Gate, a pair of heavy weapons (Gauss Exterminator for 50pts each or free Tesla Destructors), a docking station for one Sentry Pylon/Monolith which gives the docked unit +1S on its guns (docked Monoliths can't use their own Eternity Gate though), and a Power Crucible building that gives all NECRONS in the fortification 5++ vs shooting and reroll 1s on Reanimation Protocols. Each of the four buildings explodes on a 6+ when killed, and the Power Crucible's abilities disappear as it gets damaged - one turns off at 8 wounds, and you lose the other one when it dies. Costs an absolutely ludicrous 730 points, or 780/830 with the Gauss Exterminator emplacements.
